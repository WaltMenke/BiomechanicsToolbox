![tools](https://github.com/WaltMenke/BiomechanicsToolbox/assets/142276466/db4037b3-256a-45a1-a818-cdaae1543ac6)

A Python-based GUI designed to help with more efficient Biomechanics data processing and presentation.
Please refer to the `BiomechancisToolbox.docx` for further information about capabilities and how to operate the program.

If downloading all files from the main branch, run the `BiomechanicsToolbox.py` script only to initiate the program- all other python scripts are for functions or subprocess calls.

It is HIGHLY recommended to use a virtual environment and use:
`pip install -r ToolboxRequirements.txt` 
to obtain the required packages and version as easily as possible.
