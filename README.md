## Purpose
A Python-based GUI designed to help with more efficient Biomechanics data processing and presentation.
Please refer to the `BiomechancisToolbox.docx` for further information about capabilities and how to operate the program.

If downloading all files from the main branch to run in your own IDE or terminal, run the `BiomechanicsToolbox.py` script only to initiate the program- all other python scripts are for functions or subprocess calls.

## Package Installation
It is HIGHLY recommended to use a virtual environment and use:
`pip install -r ToolboxRequirements.txt` 
to obtain the required packages and version as easily as possible.

## Eexecutable Options
If you would like to use an executable version of the program instead of running it through the command line or an IDE, I've uploaded a ZIP file to Dropbox that contains the required files generated by PyInstaller.
`https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ftgjmmf4ueztktae1tgce/BiomechanicsToolboxExecutable.zip?rlkey=g2syxgvrmwornxatgzvnb9s96&dl=0`

Alternatively, you can download the Github folder 'BuildExecutable' from the repository, navigate to that directory from a terminal/powershell and run the following code to generate an executable locally.
`pyinstaller --onefile -i"BT_Icon.ico" BiomechanicsToolbox.py`

## Example Files
As of March 24th, 2024 there is a folder containing example input and output files for multiple functions. This will allow you to test the function inputs, understand the data/file structures required by the program, and look at expected outputs from these files.
